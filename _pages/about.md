Hello! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia Univeristy. I'm advised by Prof. Pierre Gentine and am a researcher with the Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics ([LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/)) NSF Science and Technology Center. I study the representation of cloud processes in Earth system models using machine learning. Before starting my PhD, I was a climate data scientist at [Gro Intelligence](https://www.gro-intelligence.com/) and recieved my AB in Earth and Planetary Science from Harvard College in 2019. If you're working on marine boundary layer clouds, cloud microphysics, or generative machine learning within the Earth Sciences, I'd love to connect!
